# shu-lab-regression-demo
Couple of notebooks to explain some basics of ML to the [Shu Lab](https://www.jianshulab.org/) journal club
- the lab was mostly wet-lab postdocs & technicians who were curious about ML 101 topics
- I went over the basics of optimization, linear vs non-linear models, regression, classification, and some common pitfalls to watch out for

Uses `jax` and interactive notebook visualizations
